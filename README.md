# settingsui-checkbox-issues-vscode README

The extension "settingsui-checkbox-issues-vscode" is a minimal example to demonstrate Settings UI issues with checkboxes when the name of the boolean setting contains the name of another setting.

Clicking the affected checkboxes can lead to changes in other affected checkboxes.

Just scrolling them in and out of the screen displays them as checked or unchecked randomly, not matching the actual configuration.
